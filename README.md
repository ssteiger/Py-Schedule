# PySchedule

![](https://imgur.com/sOpXXwy.png)

An [electron](https://electronjs.org/) app with a nice and easy UI, with which one can schedule the execution of a python file.

## Getting started
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# start app
$ npm run dev
```
There is a `.py` file in `/examples/` that you can use for a test.

## Run project formatters
```bash
# javascript
$ standard

# scss
$ csscomb src/styles/
```

## TODO's
* [ ] add the possibility to remove a single file
* [ ] create an installable package for each platform ([link](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager), [link](https://www.electron.build/code-signing#where-to-buy-code-signing-certificate))
* [ ] add a dark mode
* [ ] add more languages ([link](https://github.com/arnapou/jqcron/tree/master/src))
